## Abstract
<p align="justify">The recent development of generative AI techniques, which has increased the online diffusion of altered images and videos, raises concerns about the credibility of digital media accessible on the Internet and shared by information channels and social networks. Domains that rely on this data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and earth observation, suffer because of this problem. At this aim, being capable of geolocating a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, like GPS coordinates, is becoming crucial. 
This study addresses the challenge of linking a ground-view image, on different FoV values, to its corresponding satellite image without relying on GPS data. A novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), was introduced to achieve this. SAN-QUAD expands previous SOTA methods, leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite images. The obtained results on the CVUSA dataset show notable improvements, up to 9.8%, over previous methods when tested across all available fields of view (FoV).</p>

## Model 
![plot](./SAN_QUAD_Model.png)

## Requirements
1. This code uses a ```tensorflow``` docker with libraries ```opencv-python 4.8.0.74``` ```pillow 10.0.0``` ```transformers```, ```torch```, ```gradio_imageslider```, ```gradio 4.14.0```, ```torchvision```, ```huggingface_hub``` and runs on modern GPU of at least 6GB of memory
2. We run the code with ```Python 3.9.2```
3. Download the used CVUSA subset at the following link:

## Steps
- Clone this repository 
    - ```git clone https://github.com/MatteoPannacci/SemanticAlignNet-QUAD.git```
- For training run the following command from the shell:
    - ```python train_quad_no_session.py --train_grd_noise 360 --train_grd_FOV $YOUR_FOV --test_grd_FOV $YOUR_FOV --name $MODEL_NAME```
    - This command will run the python file ```train_quad_no_session.py```, inside it there are other possible parameters to pass as input or to leave as default value
    - ```$YOUR_FOV``` choose a value bewteen 0째 and 360째, that is the FoV value used for the ground view images
    - The trained model will be saved in the path ```./saved_models/$MODEL_NAME/```, a folder for each trained epoch will be created together with a ```train.txt``` file with a log of the training
- For testing run the following command from the shell:
    - ```python test_quad_no_session.py --test_grd_noise 360 --test_grd_FOV $YOUR_FOV --input_path $INPUT_FOLDER --output_path $OUTPUT_FOLDER```
    - This command will run the python file ```test_quad_no_session.py```, inside it there are other possible parameters to pass as input or to leave as default value
    - ```$INPUT_FOLDER``` is the path containing the keras checkpoint load
    - ```$YOUR_FOV``` choose a value bewteen 0째 and 360째, that is the FoV value used for the ground view images
    - The results of the testing phase will be saved in a file ```test.txt``` within the ```$OUTPUT_FOLDER```
- For training and testing different architectures other versions of the train and test files are provided
- Dataset
    - Once you downloaded the dataset you will have the following folders:
	    - ```bingmap``` this folder contains the original satellite view images
	    - ```polarmap``` 
            - ```normal``` this subfolder contains the polar transformed satellite images
            - ```segmap``` this subfolder contains the polar transformed segmetation mask images
		- ```segmap``` here are contained the original segmented mask images
        - ```streetview``` this folder contains the ground view images (streetview)
        - ```streetview_depth``` this folder contains the depth estimation masks of the ground view images
        - ```streetview_segmentation``` this folder contains the semantic segmentation masks of the ground view images
